# Error Handling

The Connections SDK provides comprehensive error handling with standardized error categories and codes across different payment providers.

## Error Response Structure

When a transaction fails, the SDK raises an exception with the following structure:

```python
    ErrorResponse(
        error_codes=[{
            'category': 'payment_method_error',
            'code': 'expired_card'
        }],
        provider_errors=['Expired Card'],
        full_provider_response={
            'resultCode': 'Refused',
            'refusalReason': 'Expired Card',
            'refusalReasonCode': '6'
        }
    )
```

### Exceptions

| Exception | Has ErrorResponse | Description |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| `TransactionError` | Yes | Raised when a payment transaction fails. Contains the standardized error response with error codes and provider details. |
| `ValidationError` | No | Raised when request validation fails, such as missing required fields. |
| `ConfigurationError` | No | Raised when SDK configuration is invalid, such as missing API keys or invalid settings. |
| `BasisTheoryError` | Yes | Raised when there is an error interacting with Basis Theory services. Contains error response and HTTP status. |


### Exception.ErrorResponse

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| error_codes | list[ErrorCode] | None | List of error codes indicating what went wrong |
| provider_errors | list[str] | None | List of raw error messages from the provider |
| full_provider_response | Dict[str, Any] | None | Complete response from the provider for debugging |

### ErrorCode

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| category | str | None | The error category (e.g. "authentication_error", "payment_method_error") |
| code | str | None | The specific error code within the category |


## Error Categories

The SDK standardizes errors into the following categories:

| Enum | Code | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| AUTHENTICATION_ERROR | "authentication_error" | Issues with 3DS authentication |

## Example Error Scenarios

### Expired Card

```python
try:
    response = sdk.adyen.create_transaction(transaction_request)
except Exception as e:
    # Exception will have e.error_response
    # ErrorResponse(
    #     error_codes=[{
    #         'category': 'payment_method_error',
    #         'code': 'expired_card'
    #     }],
    #     provider_errors=['Expired Card'],
    #     full_provider_response={
    #         'resultCode': 'Refused',
    #         'refusalReason': 'Expired Card',
    #         'refusalReasonCode': '6'
    #     }
    # )
```

## Best Practices

1. Use the provider errors array for detailed error messages
2. Log the full provider response for debugging purposes
3. Handle common error categories with appropriate user messaging
